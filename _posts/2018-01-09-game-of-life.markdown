You can use these keys to interact with the game,

- `P` : Pause iterations
- `F` : Increase the speed of iterations
- `S` : Reduce the speed of iterations
- `R` : Reset to default speed of iterations
- `T` : Randomize the board
- `W` : Toggle wrap around the edges
- `C` : Clear the board
- `1` : Spawn Gosper Gun at mouse position
- `2` : Spawn Pentadecathlon at mouse position

You can also use the mouse to drag and draw on the board when the iterations are paused. Use the `SHIFT` key while dragging to erase the colonies.
