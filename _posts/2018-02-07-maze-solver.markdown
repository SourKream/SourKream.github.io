You can use these keys to interact with the game,

- `P` : Pause iterations
- `R` : Restart the search
- `V` : Randomize the grid
- `B` : Create a blank grid
- `1` : Set search algorithm to Deapth First Search
- `2` : Set search algorithm to Breadth First Search
- `3` : Set search algorithm to Informed Search

You can also use the mouse to drag and draw your own maze on the board when the iterations are paused. 
Use the `SHIFT` key while dragging to erase.
